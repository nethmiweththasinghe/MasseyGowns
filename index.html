                        A bachelor gown and a Massey stole. Those who also have degrees have to wear a trencher. If you already hold a degree you may choose to wear the robes of that degree instead of the stole. [Note that you do not wear a stole and a hood together on stage.] You can hire the hood and stole for photographs.<br><br>
                        If you are receiving a degree and a diploma at these ceremonies you may wear the degree robes for both awards. It is not practicable to change between hood and stole during a ceremony.

                    <summary>Can someone else collect my robes for me? or return them?</summary>
                    <div>
                        We prefer you come yourself so we can confirm the right sizes have been ordered and to tell you how to wear it correctly. This takes 5-6 minutes.<br>
                        Another person can collect for you if you absolutely cannot do it. Please have them bring your order receipt if possible. Also make sure they know your full name and qualification.

                    <summary>Can my robes be sent to me by courier if I pay the fee?</summary>
                    <div>
                        We regret that we are unable to offer this service at graduation times as we are too busy. We would only consider it in very exceptional circumstances.<br>
                        In general the collection process only takes 5-6 minutes at the counter.<br>
                        During the rest of the year we often send out courier parcels and charge a standard $20 fee (NZ North Island), $30 fee (NZ South Island) for packing and sending and includes the return courier ticket.<br>

                    <summary>I am receiving two awards at different ceremonies. Do I pay double fees?</summary>
                    <div>
                        No. Massey University will alert us that you are going to two ceremonies and we will extend your hire period to cover both. In most cases you will wear the robes of the higher qualification to both ceremonies. Click "What to Wear" for more information.

                    <div>
                        For one month after graduation you can reclaim your robes without additional cost. This is our way of thanking you for returning them promptly so that they can be recycled through the ceremonies. After the one month you pay the full graduation fee.
